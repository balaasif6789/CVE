Update Log4j. The best defense against this vulnerability is to patch all 2.x Log4j versions to 2.16.0.
Disable Log4j Lookups. At its core, this vulnerability requires Log4j lookups to be enabled. Per this [Apache Jira ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2109), after Log4j version 2.10, passing `‐Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` to the JVM will disable Log4j lookups and protect the system from exploitation.
Remove dangerous .class files. Some systems may depend on Log4j lookups for logging, but may not need the JNDI lookup feature. 
It is possible to modify the log4j JAR file and remove these dangerous class files. This can be accomplished by extracting the JAR and deleting the `org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class` class file.
Block dangerous requests at the WAF. The JNDI lookups required for exploitation have a required prefix for Log4j to perform the lookup. Any request with with a string like `${jndi:xyz}` will trigger a JNDI lookup. The prefix `${jndi:` could be added to a blocklist in a web application firewall to block exploit attempts. Note that this approach is by its nature incomplete – we are aware of methods to bypass this, but this simple approach will at least make scanning by some lower-level attackers less effective.
